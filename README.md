Nuke Alarm Restart

Server Nuke Restart alerts with notifications, custom sound, and nuke flash with effect. You have the ability to edit the config.lua and set your time for server restarts but make sure you set it to 1min/30secs before you actual time restart. You also have the ability to change explosion locations and also the nuke flash and fall out effect. This script is a work in progress but you will be notified when it has an update.
